python3 blockchain.py

blockchain.append([blockchain[-1], 5.3])   (--> with [-1], we are accessing the last item in the list)

tx_amount = float(input('Input your transaction amount please: '))            (---> we use float because input always returns strings)

NOTE: Very handy DocString technique allowed by Python, checkout the Screenshot, notice how the highlighted function gets explained
by the use of the added DocString !!! This is a huge plus !! Respect !

NOTE: elif, break and continue: continue stops the loop on the line and brings the loop back to it's starting position, break exits the loop !
